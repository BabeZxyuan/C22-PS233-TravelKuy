- Build an initial application with an initial model consisting of 3 treats, namely: Culinary, Hotel, Tourism
- Build a model to cover every fantastic place you can visit in Jogja, Bali, and Palembang!, add features in every choice and freely choose whether restaurants, cafes or places by the typical of the city!.
- Build a model to cover fun places in 3 selected cities and add features to let you share your experiences and thoughts about those places!
- Lastly hopefully this app will cover all the fantastic and heavenly places that Indonesia has to offer for you! Rest assured! we will accompany you to the end of heaven! Let us know your destination at TravelKuy!
